<h1> 1. What is Kafka?</h1>
<b>Kafka Is Like REST but Asynchronous?</b>
 <p>You can build this type of request-response interaction with Kafka using two topics: one that transports the request and one that transports the response. People build systems like this, but in such cases the broker doesnâ€™t contribute all that much. There is no requirement for broadcast. There is also no requirement for storage. So this leaves the question: would you be better off using a stateless protocol like HTTP?
 <br/> <br/>So Kafka is a mechanism for programs to exchange information, but its home ground is event-based communication, where events are business facts that have value to more than one service and are worth keeping around. </p>
